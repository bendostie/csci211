Check out the main.scala file to see the code run
## Conventions for saving homework:
1. Save your code in file with .scala extension
2. Make sure scala files compile without errors
3. Zip scala files in .zip file
4. Zip file name format: HWX_FirstnameLastname.zip(ex. HW1_BenjaminDostie.zip)
5. Include all source files and packages that you make
6. If possible make one file named main.scala that runs all your code.
    In the main file:
    1. Print objective of each problem
    2. Print input and output for each problem


## Optional:
1. Practice writing documentation (<a href="https://docs.scala-lang.org/style/scaladoc.html#:~:text=It%20is%20important%20to%20provide%20documentation%20for%20all,about%20substance%20and%20writing%20style%20than%20about%20formatting." >Scaladocs</a>)
2. Practice writing tests for your code with SBT (<a href="https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/book/tools-sbt.html">SBT</a>)


## The hommework prompt for this example:

Write a class for each of these problems in seperate files and include them in a package

Problem 1: Create a Person class that has name and age variables

Problem 2: Create a Quicksort class that takes an unordered list  and returns an ordered list

Problem 3: Create BinarySearch class that uses pattern matching with tail recursion and returns an index

Problem 4: Use quick sort and binary search to find a Person in 
a list of Persons
